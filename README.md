##Open Gitbash

#check existing directory by typing "pwd" which stands for Present Working Directory

#If you want to change it type "cd ~/gulmu/Doccuments/" 

#this will change to new directory.

#No need to write whole directory

#Forexample, if current directory is /c/Users/gulmu

#then don't type like this  "cd ~/c/Users/gulmu/specdata/Pollutant mean"

#Because it didn't work in my case.

#Just type "cd ~/specdata/Pollutantmean
